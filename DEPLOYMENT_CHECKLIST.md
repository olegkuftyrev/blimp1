# For system updates
./scripts/server-monitor.sh security
```

## Troubleshooting

### âœ… Common Issues
- [ ] Services not starting â†’ Check PM2 logs
- [ ] Database issues â†’ Run migrations
- [ ] Nginx issues â†’ Check configuration
- [ ] Memory issues â†’ Restart services

### âœ… Useful Commands
```bash
# Check status
./scripts/server-monitor.sh status

# View logs
./scripts/server-monitor.sh logs

# Restart services
./scripts/server-monitor.sh restart

# Database operations
./scripts/server-monitor.sh db
```

## Production Considerations

### âœ… Future Enhancements
- [ ] SSL certificate setup (Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Database migration to PostgreSQL/MySQL
- [ ] Load balancing for scaling
- [ ] CDN for static assets
